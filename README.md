# OpenVault

This is the repository for **OpenVault**, a website developed by FIRST Tech Challenge Team #25710 Alpine Robotics.
The goal of this website is to make finding open source projects easy to find and use. Instead of having to spend 
hours scouring the internet or scrolling through thousands of messages, everything can be found here!

To contribute to **OpenVault** and open-source your files, go to the <a href="https://github.com/AlpineRobotics25710/OpenVaultFiles">Official OpenVaultFiles Github Repository</a>
