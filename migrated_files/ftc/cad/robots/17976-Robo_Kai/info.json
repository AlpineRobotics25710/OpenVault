The robot CAD is titled \"Full Robot V3\".\r\n\r\nThis is a CAD of Robo Kai's 2024-2025 Into the Deep robot. It features a scissor-driven dual horizontal misumi slide intake with an articulated claw intake and limelight 3a, dual vertical linear belt-driven 3-stage misumi slide delivery with claw, and custom walls with easily swappable number plates.\r\nIt does not have most of the screws and motors, but other than that it is very accurate to the physical design.\r\n\r\nThe robot's name is Johnny btw :)",
